Perform npm i when you have successfully cloned the project.

As per the task assignment we cannot use any database and 3rd party image storage service. 
So we have used LOCAL-STORAGE (https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-storage) package reffered as "ls" in the code so that we can access data throughout the project and images are uploaded to uploads folder.

Please find the exported postman collection.
